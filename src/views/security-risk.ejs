								<img style="border:1px solid red;" src="#" alt="Security Risk Assessment"><br><br> A security risk
								assessment is essential to understand the threats that could damage your building, people or brand. We
								therefore first need to know what your vulnerabilities are and how a threat could exploit
								them.<br><br>The following elements will be considered:<br>
								<strong>Assets:</strong><br> These are the things we want to protect, such as people, property, brand
								reputation, and information, an organisation cannot function if its assets are comprised <br>
								<strong>Threats:</strong><br> These are what we protect against, they aim to exploit our vulnerability
								to reach our Assets. <br>
								<strong>vulnerability:</strong><br> These are the weakness in our protection of assets. They are what
								threats aim to exploit. Vulnerabilities and weakness can be strengthened to mitigate against potential
								threats. <br>
								<strong>Risks:</strong><br> This is about potential for threat and vulnerability to interact. It is the
								potential for damage, loss, and destruction to your Assets. Risk can have treatment methods applied.
								<br><br> For a successful security risk assessment, we need to identify what the assets are and how your
								organisation interacts with them. It is important to understand both people and culture that surrounds
								assets. <br><br> Osprey Security can provide a comprehensive security risk assessment that looks at your
								assets, vulnerabilities and risks. <br><br> Typically, the Security Risk Assessment comprises: <ul
									class="features-list-1 general-features"><br>
									<li>Risk identification and analysis.</li>
									<li>Threat and vulnerability assessment.</li>
									<li>Review of site and facility security.</li>
									<li>Analysis of crime data.</li>
									<li>Review of compliance</li>
									<li>Facility operating procedures assessment</li>
									<li>Evaluation of physical, electronic and architectural security systems, together with the relevant
										policies and procedures.</li>
									<li>Security management and personnel analysis.</li>
								</ul> <br><br> By providing security risk assessments on an existing site, or by working with building
								design professionals on a new project. we can recommended solutions that will minimise or transfer risk
								and mitigate against threats identified. <br><br> We conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment,
								and then develop conceptual security design ideas either through site visits or analysis of
								architectural drawings. <br><br> We the produce a report, highlighting all the important information in
								an easy to understand format with diagrams and images detailing the issues bespoke to your site. Without
								a security risk assessment, it is impossible to protect what is most important to you. <br><br> Please
