								<img style="border:1px solid red;" src="#" alt="Fire Risk Asessment"><br><br> From 1st October 2006 The
								Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 requires the Responsible Person (RP) of any non-domestic
								premises to carry out a fire risk assessment. This is the principal legislation covering fire
								risk.<br><br>It is a requirement of the Fire Safety Order that all ‘responsible persons’ carry out a
								fire risk assessment of their premises in order to ensure the safety of all employees and other
								‘relevant persons’.<br><br>It is recommended this is reviewed every 12 months, or when layouts and / or
								occupants change, or when material amends are made to the building fabric, or if the purpose of the
								building is altered. <br><br> Legislation applies to you if you are:<ul
									class="features-list-1 general-features">
									<br>
									<li>– Responsible for business premises</li>
									<li>– An employer or self-employed with business premises</li>
									<li>– A charity or voluntary organisation</li>
									<li>– A contractor with a degree of control over any premises</li>
									<li>– Providing accommodation for paying guests</li>
								</ul> <br><br> Under the FSO, the responsible person must carry out a fire safety risk assessment and
								implement and maintain a fire management plan. Osprey Marine Security can survey the premises in
								compliance with current legislation providing you with a fire risk assessment, and implement the
								appropriate course of action. <br><br> Although every fire risk assessment is unique, the following fire
								prevention and fire risk factors are checked: <br><br>
								<ul class="features-list-1 specific-features">
									<li>The building’s construction, layout, and use</li>
									<li>The nature and number of occupants, including any potentially vulnerable occupants</li>
									<li>Electrical equipment on the site that could be a potential source of ignition</li>
									<li>Whether the building has a history of any fire loss</li>
									<li>Defence against arson</li>
									<li>Smoking areas as well as prevention measures that have been taken to prevent fires caused by
										smoking </li>
									<li>Protection against fires caused by lightning</li>
									<li>Installed and portable heating devices that can trigger fires</li>
									<li>Any fire hazards that have been introduced by outside contractors or building works</li>
									<li>General housekeeping and key areas being kept clear of any combustible materials</li>
									<li>The configuration and maintenance of escape routes</li>
									<li>Storage arrangements for any flammable and dangerous liquids</li>
									<li>Emergency lighting</li>
									<li>Measures are in place for limiting fire spread</li>
									<li>Adequate means are in place to raise the alarm in the event of a fire</li>
									<li>Fire safety signs are in the proper locations and used correctly</li>
									<li>Other devices, like sprinklers, are properly installed and maintained</li>
									<li>The appropriate fire extinguishers are in the correct locations</li>
									<li>Whether or not there are regular evacuation drills and fire safety training</li>
									<li>Who manages the building’s fire safety and how well it is done</li>
									<li>Proper records and documentation kept on fire safety measures</li>
									<li>Correct testing procedures and maintenance in place for fire safety systems</li>
								</ul> <br><br> See <a href="#">this example</a> of a fire risk assessment. <br>
